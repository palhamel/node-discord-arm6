## Project for Pi with Linux - a Discord bot in Node.js

##### This project was about getting a Discord Bot up and running on my Pi - using Node.js. Seemed pretty simple...:)

My Pi is an early version, "Pi 3", running on a 'armv6l' processor and that required a bit of work to get node installed correctly.
As I'm using this Pi only via CLI I also wanted some kind of simple file sharing using VS Code on my mac to code.

I started setup an AFP server with user and shares but then learned the hard way that AFP shares and Git is not working at all.
SMB needed so I setup a SAMBA server on the Pi and got it to work perfectly fine. Also with Git via my mac to commit changes to GitHub and keep on working on the code via VS Code.

Discord js is used and for the Bot I also installed and setup .env for the auth tokens generated by Discord.

The Bot works great and I will keep working on it more to explore what can be made. I also need to see to what version I can update on this ARM processor. Discord.js really want a Node version >12, but right now I have a earlier and it's working great.

Fun project to explore and to solve problems that pops up. :)
