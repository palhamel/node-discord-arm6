## Project for Pi with Linux - a Discord bot in Node.js

This project was about getting a Discord Bot up and running on my Pi - using Node.js.
Seemed pretty simple...:)

My Pi is an early "Pi 3" running on 'armv6l' and that requires a bit of work to get node installed correctly.
As I'm using my Pi only via CLI I also wanted some kind of simple file sharing using VS Code on my mac.

I started setup an AFP server, users and shares but learned the hard way that AFP shares and Git is not working at all.
SMB needed so I setup a SAMBA server on the Pi and got it to work perfectly fine, also with Git via my mac to commit changes to GitHub.

For the Bot I also used installed and setup .env for the auth tokens generated by Discord.
